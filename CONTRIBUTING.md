How to contribute
=================

Thank you for considering contributing!

Reporting issues
----------------

- Describe what you expected to happen.
- If possible, include a [minimal, complete, and verifiable example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve
) to help us identify the issue. This also helps check that the issue is not with your own code.
- Describe what actually happened. Include the full traceback if there was an exception.

Submitting patches
------------------

- Include tests if your patch is supposed to solve a bug, and explain
  clearly under which circumstances the bug happens. Make sure the test fails
  without your patch.
- Make sure all commits are verified.
- Make sure there are no trailing spaces in the any of the modified files.

Start coding
------------

- Create a branch to identify the issue you would like to work on (e.g.
  `2287-dry-test-suite`)
- Using your favorite editor, make your changes, [committing as you go](https://dont-be-afraid-to-commit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/commandlinegit.html#commit-your-changes).
- Make sure there are no trailing spaces in the any of the modified files.
- Include tests that cover any code changes you make. Make sure the test fails
  without your patch.
- Push your commits to GitHub and [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).
- Celebrate ðŸŽ‰
